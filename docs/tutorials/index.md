will focus on a **learning-oriented** approach.
You'll learn how to get started with the code in this project.

Note that this documentation is still in progress.

## Getting-started tutorials
Currently available tutorials are

+ Getting started with learning independent, parametric priors from expert knowledge
  + [Go to notebook](getting-started-param.py)
+ Getting started with learning joint, non-parametric prior from expert knowledge
  + [Go to notebook](getting-started-deep.py)

## Case studies
Currently available Case Studies are

+ Human-Growth Model as introduced in [Manderson & Goudie (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08528)
